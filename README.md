# Breeze [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/scalanlp/breeze.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/scalanlp/breeze)

Breeze is a library for numerical processing. It aims to be generic, clean, and powerful without sacrificing (much) efficiency.

The current version is 0.11-SNAPSHOT. The latest release is 0.11-M0.
## Documentation

* https://github.com/scalanlp/breeze/wiki/Quickstart
* https://github.com/scalanlp/breeze/wiki/Breeze-Linear-Algebra
* https://github.com/scalanlp/breeze/wiki/UserGuide
* [Scaladoc](http://www.scalanlp.org/api/breeze/)

Note:

Breeze used to have more components. Their new homes are described below:

* breeze-learn (machine learning) is now in [Nak](https://github.com/scalanlp/nak).
* breeze-process (natural language processing) has become [Epic](https://github.com/dlwh/epic).

There is also the [scala-breeze google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/scala-breeze) for general questions and discussion.

## Using Breeze

### Building it yourself.

This project can be built with sbt 0.13

### SBT

For **SBT**, Add these lines to your SBT project definition:

* For SBT versions 0.13.x or later

```scala
libraryDependencies  ++= Seq(
  // other dependencies here
  "org.scalanlp" %% "breeze" % "0.10",
  // native libraries are not included by default. add this if you want them (as of 0.7)
  // native libraries greatly improve performance, but increase jar sizes.
  "org.scalanlp" %% "breeze-natives" % "0.10"
)

resolvers ++= Seq(
  // other resolvers here
  // if you want to use snapshot builds (currently 0.11-SNAPSHOT), use this.
  "Sonatype Snapshots" at "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/",
  "Sonatype Releases" at "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/"
)

// or 2.11.5
scalaVersion := "2.10.4"
```

For more details on the optional `breeze-natives` module, please watch Sam Halliday's talk at Scala eXchange 2014 [High Performance Linear Algebra in Scala](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/5849-high-performance-linear-algebra-in-scala) ([follow along with high-res slides](http://fommil.github.io/scalax14/#/)).


### Maven

Maven looks like this:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.scalanlp</groupId>
  <artifactId>breeze_2.10</artifactId> <!-- or 2.11 -->
  <version>0.10</version>
</dependency>
```

### Other build tools

http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.scalanlp/breeze_2.10/0.10 (as an example) is a great resource for finding other configuration examples for other build tools.

See documentation (linked above!) for more information on using Breeze.

## History

Breeze is the merger of the ScalaNLP and Scalala projects, because one of the original maintainers is unable to continue development. The Scalala parts are largely rewritten.
